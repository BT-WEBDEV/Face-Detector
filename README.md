# Face-Detector
Case Use: Small Python project using a haarcascade to detect a face within an image and capture video from webcam. Can detect multiple faces within an image and surrounds the face with a green image. 

Modules Used: 

OpenCV

PLEASE READ THIS FIRST - The repository contains two primary scripts called "face_detector.py" and "webcam_capture.py". The Face Detector takes an image (I've only used a .jpg) to detect a face within the image. The Webcam Capture script is mostly set up for another project and lets us capture webcam video. 

To Run This Script: 

Make sure you have OpenCV installed.

Make sure you have included the following example image within the same directory as the script. 

If you want to use a different image - please add your new image (use .jpg) to the directory and then change line 11 in the Face Detector script to match the name of your image. 

Run the Face Detector Script or Webcam Capture Script.
